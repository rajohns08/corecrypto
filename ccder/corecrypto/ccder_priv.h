 @function   ccder_decode_uint_skip_leading_zeroes
 @abstract   Return the pointer on the most significant byte
            Caller must ensure there is no overread (der + *len < der_end) prior
            to calling this.
 Per ITU-T Rec. X.690 (07/2002), section 8.3 "If the contents octets of an integer value 
 encoding consist of more than one octet, then the bits of the first octet
 and bit 8 of the second octet, Shall not all be ones and shall not be zero".
 Here we only allow unsigned integers.

 @param      der        Beginning of input DER buffer
 @param      len        Pointer to the length. Update to the number of remaining byte
                        it may contain 0 as input/output.

 @result     Pointer on the most significant byte
            NULL is too many leading zeroes
