The corecrypto (cc) project
===========================

The main goal is to provide low level fast math routines and crypto APIs which
can be used in various environments (Kernel, bootloader, userspace, etc.).  It
is an explicit goal to minimize dependancies between modules and functions so
that clients of this library only end up with the routines they need and
nothing more.

Corecrypto compiles under all Apple OSs, Windows, Android and Linux.

**NOTE:** This repo is a fork of the `corecrypto` source code provided at https://developer.apple.com/security. No modifications to the `corecrypto` source code have been made - only build/project files.

### Module Subdirectories

Each module has the following subdirectories:

* `corecrypto`:     headers for this module
* `src`:            sources for this module
* `doc`:            documentation, references, etc.
* `xcunit`:         XCTest based unit tests for this module.
* `crypto_tests`:   sources for executable tests for this module
* `test_vectors`:   test vectors for this module
* `tools`:          sources for random helper tools.

The following subdirections don't follow the module layout yet:

* `corecrypto_kext`:   Supporting files for kernel extension build and fips support.
* `corecrypto_dylib`:  Supporting files for userspace shared lib build and fips support.
